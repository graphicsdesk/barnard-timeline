According to Hungerford, the survey found that Arts and Sciences does have available physical space to host all of their labs and classes, but the space is old and not fitted for modern science, and the Arts and Sciences does not have enough money to renovate it immediately."

The donation—which is more than double the previous single largest in Barnard’s history—is one of many made by the Vagelos family, whose donations have helped facilitate the construction of the Diana Center, the computer science center, and Barnard’s successful financial aid matching program.
